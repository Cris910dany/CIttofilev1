hey you are reading me right to use "cittofile" is very simple. As soon as you start the program for the first time it will create a key in the folder and you will have to select it when it asks you. (it will ask you for the key only when you start the program a second time). As soon as you enter the real program it will ask you whether to encrypt, decrypt or reset the key, well if you want to encrypt a message write "c" and enter the message then it will ask you what you want to call the file and you will find it in the "cittofile" folder, if you write "d" you will have to insert a .txt file encrypted by the same program otherwise it will give you an error. finally if you write "r" it will change the key but the function still must be accurate so DON'T LOSE THE KEY!. 
WARNINGS
if you put the running program as the key the program will close and give you an error and even if you download it again it won't work anyway so DON'T DO IT!. Well thanks for reading and have fun.
(remember that if something doesn't work don't hesitate to write to me :D)
